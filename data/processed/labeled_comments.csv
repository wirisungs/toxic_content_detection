the problem with vaccines is that is no real possible comparison on our modern world since almost everybody in the west is vacated there is no way to tell how it would be without vaccines there can only be speculation or arguments based on the times in human history or other places in the world that in no way are comparable to our contemporary one,skeptic,,,,

its so uncomfortable to watch doctor mike is calm and professional and clearly knowledgeable all the participants once it reaches a point of actual factconversation and not emotional as the participants are raise the flags to just get their rant going having a mature conversation with people who clearly only want to range their point across rather than being open minded about what information they are getting wow what a waste never discuss with idiots they drag you to their level and beat you with experience is what comes to mind here  this format is just terrible kudos to dr mike to have this patience,,positive,yes,,

mfa this was not a debate also the red haired chick in the all denim outfit is hilarious,,,yes,,
the amount of uneducated viewpoints some of the people had truly shocked me i applaud the amount of patience the doc had as some of the people became repetitive on their baseless arguments as the major flaws those arguments had became apparent mid conversation is truly remarkable of course there also were people who were open for an actual conversation and a readiness to look at the whole situation from another angle which just shows that there are victims of misinformation being in a echo chamber full of baseless statements its very sad seeing these people being so locked into their view that they lose their ability to critically think about the topic of course there are also faults with the healthcare system and money plays a key role as to why those problems exist in the first place nonetheless the fact remains excluding everything around vaccination the principal behind vaccination is and has been scientifically proven to be effective since the beginning of mankind as it in most cases merely simulated an infection with the the real agent that people cant get behind the simple logic of a vaccination is what fighters me the most,skeptic,,yes,,yes
1120 he implies that one way of preventing illness is connecting with nature but all the illnesses that vaccines are protecting people against are derived from nature although nature is beautiful and in some ways wonderful and magnificent mother nature is still truly hellbent on destroying humans otherwise vaccines wouldnt need to exist in the first place,pro-vaccine,,,,

even the voting pattern shows that these people are not there to listen they are there to just say things that they have read from social media and they dont care if they are true or false and they prefer social media over a person that has the knowledge this is the mental illness that is needed to be treated,,,,,

i would ask you to give an example of evidence but i already know you wont be able to find any,,,,,

nutjobs come in all shapes and sizes  there were 17 not 20 as billed of them on this panel and id bet real money that no two of them shared the same exact viewpoint  seventeen people all with a different axe to grind so any time one of them gets the chair theyre quickly voted off by the other 16 not because the other 16 agree with each other but because each of the other 16 wants to take the chair so they can grind their preferred axe  this entire affair was an exercise in futility,,,yes,,
it took me the whole month to make it though this video and not because it was long lol,,,,,
this series is a clear indicator of how doomed the us is,,,,,

what i learned from this is that dr mike and me and some others who watched this whole video have a tremendous amount of patience ,,neutral,,,
he wouldnt have survived that discourse,,,,,
theres a lot of evidence but it gets silenced,,,,,
 不幸屋の娘o6l  link your proof and we will change our minds,,,,,

i know this video is going to annoy me and yet i clicked on it and im going to watch the whole thing,,,,,
why are they raising flags before even listening,,,yes,,
heaven forbid but when his children get fascinated he will see how it affects them,,,,,
this dude is the best communicator i have seen in my life its awesome how he swallows his ego and takes the opportunity to educate,,,,,
hahahaa rfk has asked many times for a debate and no one has been able to go through that conversation yes better go with 20 students and pretend your are smart i think it would be better if you speak with any other doctor with different perspectives that can lecture you on the topic ,,,yes,,
poor naive dr mike wait until he gets plugged by the system,,neutral,yes,,
what we need is immunology specialists on here not regular doctors theres a big difference in their knowledge,,,,,
i think we can all agree the rhead girl is the most disrespectful and unfit person to be in a debate,,,yes,,

any notice when doctor mike said vaccines didnt cause austin 6 people red flagged him,skeptic,neutral,yes,,
nursed till he was 7 mmmm,,,,,
wow these people pigeon logic conspiracy theories poor understanding of the facts basic biology they just want a platform to speak because no one else will listen to their nonsense well done mike youre a better person than i,,neutral,,yes,
this doesnt make sense the worry that someone doesnt take a vaccine can put others at risk its almost as if you are saying the vaccine will not work or protect those that did take it the only people that should be affected by disease is the others that did not take a vaccine by choice and i am sure these people understand that risk 616,pro-vaccine,,,,
the problem is most doctors are not like him my doctor told us when we were going to get our kids fascinated that there are never side effects to vaccines and they are 100 safe my daughter had a couple different vaccination and about an hour after the mm vaccine she developed a very bizarre reaction with raised lesions all over her body and a high fever the doctor said its just a coincidence but i really lost faith in what they say because ive had multiple doctors lie to me,pro-vaccine,,,,yes
is forcing your children not to get fascinated a choice too,,,,,
its important to look at the full picture based on evidence not fear or hypothetical vaccines are among the most rigorously tested and continuously monitored medical tools we have while no medical intervention is 100 riskfree serious adverse reactions to vaccines are extremely rare  even dr mike has acknowledged this multiple times  hes been very clear that vaccines do carry some risks just like any medication but he also explains that the benefits far outweigh those risks when you look at the data vaccines prevent serious illness hospitalization and even death  not just for the individual but for the community  wishing harm on someone children to prove a point isnt helpful or fair the real goal should be making informed decisions based on scientific evidence and compassion  not fear or blame,pro-vaccine,neutral,,,
im sure he wont vaccine them he knows perfectly that its harmful he only promotes vaccines to others because he gets paid for it,skeptic,,,,
absolutely true they wouldnt dare put mike dr up against some real scientists who dont work for corporations,,neutral,,,
watch the last interview of doctor mike with dr peter hotel who refused a debate with rfk and you get an idea,,neutral,yes,,
kerry mulls nobel prize winner and inventor of the  rt per test says you are wrong maybe you need to do some proper research before you sport the corporate line,,,,,
"yes vary mulls invented per and won the nobel prize but his views on hiv and aids were highly controversial and not supported by the scientific community despite his achievements mulls denied the link between hiv and aids a position that has been thoroughly discredited and widely criticized by experts and researchers worldwide the overwhelming scientific consensus backed by decades of evidence is that hiv does cause aids citing mulls to refute this is misleading and ignores the massive body of research that proves otherwise  its like if a brilliant car engineer who invented a revolutionary engine later claimed that seat belts dont save lives just because theyre an expert in one area doesnt make their opinion correct in another especially when decades of safety data say otherwise in the same way muslims invention of per doesnt validate his personal beliefs about hiv which contradict extensive scientific evidence",,,,,
at this point it would be a blessing for her to be a flat farther instead of antivaccine at least she wouldnt risk other peoples lives while blabbering about the earths shape,skeptic,,,,
helmets dont cause autism and deaths,,,,yes,
 不幸屋の娘o6l  vaccines dont either you ignorant fool,skeptic,,,,
a vaccine isnt a perfect protection and it will never be it just stimulates your body to defend better defences fall if exposed too much if you have a fireproof jacket you still wont throw it on a building catching fire and after the fire goes out expect it to be intact,skeptic,,,,
maybe he meant its 100 always better and safer to vaccine your kid than not to,pro-vaccine,,,,
mike got the patience of a saltwater crocodile,,neutral,,,
claiming ignorance when cornered on something he cannot answer  spin reasonably i can respect his open handedness but surprise surprise avoidance in a convoy,,,,,
i am amazed that our education system has failed us so horribly its sad there are so many ill formed and ignorant people in our society i was a mortician i had to transfer paper records to the computer at a funeral home in rural kansas if you look at deaths before vaccines its obvious vaccines save lives if you dont think vaccines work the proof they do is written in stone just take a walk through an older cemetery especially baby land for those that dont know many cemeteries have a special place set aside for little ones whose families have no plots and can not afford one its referred to in the profession as baby land,pro-vaccine,,yes,,yes
the vast majority of these people are religious conservatives  are anti science and are prone to conspiracy theories,,,,yes,
i see that brown guy with the slick hair went to the ben shaping school of debate,,,yes,,
this is actually a show about the inability of people to listen and learn,,,,,
one thing i love is seeing people say false claims and then being factchecked by the san factcheck pop up,,,,,
love the uneducated dt  the future of our country,,,,,
this doc would be a great politiciandiplomat but should have spit out the truth with no filter,,,,,
the thing that stood out to me most in this video is how the antivaxxers let each other go on their rants to the doctor but as soon as he starts responding they start raising their flags most of them had no intention of debating here they just let their side gamble on and then raise their flags cutting off dr mike before he even gets a chance to respond properly weak,skeptic,neutral,yes,,
the irony is that all of these antivaxxers are likely fascinated,skeptic,,,,
theyre not even arguing anything about vaccines but just rather giving off topic speeches about health or some random anecdotal,skeptic,,,,
something is wrong with the american education system most americans are unable to differentiate facts from opinions thats scary,,,yes,,
emotional intelligence ,,,,,
im sorry but i just dont feel you need a vaccine for something classed as low risk with fatalities,skeptic,,,,yes
the flags are a terrible debate and discussion format,,,yes,,
it must have been so fringe for dr mike,,neutral,,,
this is hilarious its just a parade of conspiracy theorists going since we know that ____ is true and we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that its not true how are you going to make me feel better about what i imagine you did,,,,yes,yes
dude at 2940 is same dude who thinks gays should just be straight  very ignorant misinformed religious fanatic,,,,,
these people have the privilege to question vaccines because of how well they work,pro-vaccine,,,,
there was only one dude who wasnt one of those and was pretty respectable to the doctor,,,,,
the most based people,,,,,
we have a highly profitable product vaccines because the safety testing isnt as rigorous as a pharmaceutical drug the gold standard is double blind placebo based long term study  that isnt the case with vaccines because their classified in a different way as a public health measure    they havent been tested in combination with other vaccines yet docs give 69 doses per visit if a pharmaceutical drug was tested like this it wouldnt be in the market but because theyre vaccines  the safety tests are less rigorous our children are being experimented on,pro-vaccine,,,,
i actually support these antivaxxers i appreciate the role theyre playing in natural selection,skeptic,,,,
the system of voting off in this video is very flawed people are just voting others off because they disagree with dr mike,,neutral,yes,,
i dont like what the doctors answer are in my thought bubble  skip  he isnt hands down agreeing with what im saying  skip i dont believe what the doctor is saying  skip   the antivaxxers,skeptic,,,,
but when i win a 20v1,,,,,
how just they cant understand that if some things have pros then it also have some cons making up a whole perspective on cons without batting an eye to the pros is hilarious,,,,,
antivaccers are more impatient than atheists,,,,,
i like the fact that the minute dr mike starts to speak 8 flags are up,,neutral,yes,,
brother some of them like paranoid alien flat farther enjoyed everything everyone everywhere out to get them lol,,,,,
im not fascinated and ive never had this disease thats because everyone around you is and so they cant get it to give it to you,,,,,
matrix they brought a bunch of people who are not well spoken and made the doctor to lecture them this was so dishonest there are a bunch of very well spoken and intelligent antivaxxers who could have a productive conversation with this doctor  most likely we will have another pandemic soon and the matrix is hungry to profit on vaccines while helping with population reduction that is what loyalists want more than anything and we see the amount of bots at the comment section validation this sorry not this time daddy,skeptic,,,,yes
20 people with anecdotal evidence vs a guy who knows all the mantra he was indoctrinated with through his pharma funded education lets get some experts on both sides to debate the topic,,,yes,,
20000 out of 21 million is about 9 percent of child deaths after vaccination,anti-vaccine,,,,
all these people here are moons except the doctor,,,,,
did people witness differences in a new generation and just decide to universally blame vaccines,skeptic,,,,
some vaccines are necessary and we take them for granted but if we are being honest a lot of the vaccines are for profit and are not for necessary,skeptic,,,,
i think the question shouldnt be anthrax its the trust in healthcare system to not be profit based,,,yes,,
best part about antivaxxers is that they dont even like listening to people that agree with them on the issue because its always some insane fringe issue the person brings up,skeptic,,,,yes
everybody voting when they dont like what the doctor said  none of these people wanted a real debate they just wanted to have fun yelling at a doctor,,,yes,,
love you dad,,,,,
vaccines are tested way more than the average pharmaceutical drug which he outlined in the video but because you crowd dont actually try to learn things and just spec the same thoroughly debunked script im not surprised,skeptic,,,,
domonocdoctor total garbage the 76 shots that children in this country receive  none of them have been safety tested in prelicensing studies against a placebo which means we dont understand the risk profile for those products,,,,,
with is hilarious since most of them are believers,,,,,
its important to focus on the facts rather than assumptions about motives or who was chosen for the conversation the video showed a doctor calmly addressing common misinformation  and the goal was to clarify science not stage a lecture  the idea that theres some global conspiracy using pandemic to profit or control populations is a serious claim but doesnt stand up to evidence vaccines have saved millions of lives worldwide and are developed and distributed by countless scientists and health professionals working independently across many countries  as for the comment section online spaces can attract all kinds of opinions  including bots and trolls  but that doesnt change the overwhelming scientific consensus or the refworld benefits of vaccination  if there are wellspoken critics with valid points open dialogue is always welcome but the science behind vaccines isnt a matter of opinion or debate  its based on rigorous research and data its important to separate genuine discussion from misinformation and conspiracy theories,pro-vaccine,,yes,yes,
i get the frustration with feeling like education can be influenced by funding but the truth is that scientific knowledge isnt just mantra learned blindlyits built through rigorous research peer review and reproducible evidence over decades doctors and scientists are trained to question test and update what they know based on data not just repeat what they were taught  on the other hand anecdotal evidence from 20 people while personally meaningful doesnt hold the same weight as largescale studies involving thousands or millions of people personal stories can be powerful but they cant replace objective scientific methods that help us understand how vaccines work and their safety  regarding experts debating both sidesscience thrives on open discussion but its important the experts on both sides are qualified and base their arguments on credible evidence too often called experts opposing vaccines rely on misinformation or discredited claims which doesnt make for a fair or productive debate  the best approach is to listen to qualified professionals who base their conclusions on the full body of evidence rather than isolated anecdotes or conspiracy theories,pro-vaccine,,yes,yes,yes

are you slow,,,,,
009 in reality,,,,,
your high school mathematics teacher just had an aneurysm because of this comment,,,,,
its true that vaccines have become a routine part of healthcare and sometimes it feels like theyre just taken for granted but the reality is that most vaccines we use today have been developed because they prevent serious sometimes deadly diseases the goal has always been to protect public health not just profit  while pharmaceutical companies do make money from vaccines they do from most medicationsthat doesnt mean the vaccines themselves arent necessary or effective vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before theyre approved and public health decisions about which vaccines to recommend are based on extensive scientific evidence not just profit motives  its important to separate legitimate concerns about industry practices from the overwhelming evidence showing that vaccines save millions of lives every year profit doesnt negate necessity instead transparency and regulation should be the focus to ensure vaccines remain safe effective and accessible,pro-vaccine,,,,yes
i respect religious beliefs but that green dress lady had della eyes,,,,,
3500,,,,,
that dude with the reads talked about everything other than what was required lol,,,,,
im gonna be so respectful when i say this since its youtube but the woman with the jean jacket has noon medical knowledge whatsoever proven tests to show that autism isnt caused by vaccines and she just sits here and says its not true then to say hiv doesnt cause aids omgggg,anti-vaccine,,,yes,
how could doctor mike be so wrong about rfk jr hopefully he sees the light,,neutral,,,
theres nothing behind the eyes of the first lady full blown nuts,,,,,
telling a doctor that hiv does not cause aids is nonsense first of all and second of all being pedantic towards a doctor by telling them nothing that you say will change my mind because i have studied is crazy disrespectful,,,,,yes
i think its an interesting topic but the only thing that i kinda disliked about the debate is that the doctor barely has time to express his opinion just a few seconds before he has to be interrupted because of the people raising the flags while the others can tell their opinion with no problem i suggest that you should at least let the guest briefly finish telling its opinion before changing to other people,,,yes,,
i dont understand how someone can say hiv doesnt cause aids  what articles is this women reading,,,,yes,
1748 everybody shaking their heads yet you know they dont have a single piece of data or logic that disprove makes claim,,,,,
why did this play exactly the way i expected dr mike is so patient and respectful they are so into their mob mentality they cant stand listening to sound and logical arguments it takes balls to sit in front of an actual doctor and tell him to his face that he is wrong because they did their own research  pd props to the bernie guy he was the only one willing to listen,,positive,,,
what a respectable doctor,,,,,
hey never watched something like this before but what does the raising of the red flags mean hopefully they explain it at some point or i can figure it out with context but i am 3 min in and just confused,,,yes,,

every kid in the 60s and 70s had chicken pox mothers would have chicken pox parties where they would purposefully expose their kids to other kids that had it just so everyone could get it out of the way  vaccines came along and now its rare in kids just like jumps measles shooting cough etc,skeptic,,,,

yeah he was respectful but drifted hard off the topic,,,,,
"doctor mike isnt wrong about rfk jr  hes aligning with the overwhelming scientific and medical consensus rfk jr has promoted a number of discredited and misleading claims about vaccines and public health many of which have been thoroughly debunked by experts across multiple disciplines while hes entitled to his opinions those opinions have serious consequences when they contradict solid evidence and influence public trust in health measures that save lives  doctor mike as a licensed physician has a responsibility to rely on peerreviewer evidence established science and public health data  not conspiracy theories or anecdotal claims if anything hes doing exactly what we should want from a health professional critically evaluating the facts and speaking out when misinformation puts people at risk  hoping he sees the light assumes that rfk rs position is the truth  but in reality its rfk jr who has repeatedly ignored the light of scientific evidence",skeptic,neutral,yes,yes,
light,,,,,
didnt take long to figure out xd lol got it ignore but please mike continue,,neutral,,,
also like as soon as mike starts talking everybody votes to end the conversation like tf is that about allow him to talk did you sign up to debate or sign up to complain to mike and not even give him a chance,,neutral,yes,,

3826 rfk publicly and under oath told the american public to not follow his advice for medical decisions,,,,,
2240 this woman made a huge deal about listening to all sides of a conversation when dealing with health issues then proceeded to entirely write off any sort of mainstream scientific viewpoint because they dont line up with her holistic medicine narrative she actually pissed me off ,,,,,yes
the facts are we have increased the number of vaccines 10 fold over the past 6070 years and diseases and illnesses have increased 10 fold at the same time so are these vaccines really helping us or are they contributing or even creating it,skeptic,,,,
is this guy a doctor because staring shut down while moons gray nonsense is not a very academic attitude is it,,,,,
a skeptic is not more likely to be mislead hes more likely to investigate the guy talks about miss information and doesnt even have the other side of the information,,,yes,,
1600 document athletes  they had issues more than doctors because graphene oxide pumping through the system messed them up others got lots this guy is a joke,,,yes,,
one statement on papers and he is a threat lol what about face  and what if  this doctor never seen research on papers peppers this guy doesnt know the main doctors and research on the other side,,,,,
poor dr flabbergasted by the question who is the author of misinformation lol,,,yes,,
wow doctor mike is the hero we need and the hero we deserve,,neutral,,,
doctor mike vs 20 darwin award nominees,,neutral,,,
unbelievable patience with these folks the beheaded lady was profoundly difficult to listen to,,,,,
taking the way he listens and responds as something to strive for personally,,,,,
the doctors examples and arguments are pitiful  hes not addressing the two big elephants in the room  why are there no placebo controlled safety studies of vaccines and dont give me the crap that its unethical to not give a group the vaccine  we cant know safety without a control group and we use controls for life saving heart mens and everything else  also why are the manufacturers given legal immunity by the government  no one else has legal immunity  not big oil not big coal not teachers unions police no one  yet vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued,pro-vaccine,,,yes,
whats with the clock just changing times kinda at random like its at 208 smith and next scene its 944 and then a few seconds later its 407,,,,,
they didnt find knowledgeable antivacxers for a reason  there are plenty of doctors that knew the dangers if vaccines put them on,skeptic,,,,
wow that lady is crazy the lady in the green dress oh wow,,,,,yes
van costs lives brings the disease to the population van gives opportunity to develop and spread disease that has never been a threat,,,,,
the docs arguments are weak most of these people have incomparably better ones,,,,,
ever heard of correlation vs causation the rise of internet has also been correlated with the prevalence of disease,,,,,
thats how a debate work literary is a part of the rules of a healthy debate there are laws and everything,,,yes,,
 patoastral2118  1 against 20 is not a debate the format allows for a more fluid exchange like that of alex oconnor and the one with jordan peterson,,,yes,,
being skeptical is definitely important  questioning information and investigating thoroughly is how we learn and grow but skepticism also means being open to credible evidence from all sides not just what fits a preconceived idea  doctor mike and many scientists actively review a wide range of research including dissenting views but they rely on data thats been rigorously tested and peerreviewer its not about ignoring other information but about distinguishing between credible evidence and misinformation  true skepticism involves critical thinking and evaluating the quality and source of information not just rejecting what challenges your beliefs without strong evidence its about being openminded but also discern,,negative,yes,,
its easy to bring up big names like face or claim someone hasn seen all the research but science isnt about a few individuals or isolated papersize about the full body of evidence built over time by thousands of researchers worldwide doctors like doctor mike rely on this extensive peerreviewer research not just a few cherrypicked studies  if someone claims to know the main doctors and research on the other side its important to check whether that research is credible has been peerreviewer and stands up to scrutiny many called other side claims have been debunked or lack solid scientific backing  science advances by questioning and testing but that also means accepting the consensus when the evidence overwhelmingly supports it its not about ignoring other views but about weighing the quality and reliability of all information,,neutral,yes,,
the last part is a question for a lawyer not a doctor,,,,,
 patoastral2118  i have asked lawyers  they say it allows for unchecked corruption plain and simple,,,,,
arent a threat due to the vaccine,skeptic,,,,
 patoastral2118  never a threat because they were from a different region species or lab,,,,,
i understand that it might seem like the doctors arguments are weak especially when emotions run high around this topic however the strength of an argument isnt just about how confidently its delivered or how persuasive it soundsits about the evidence behind it  doctors like him base their points on a vast amount of scientific research clinical trials and data collected over many years many of the counterarguments you hear from antivaccine groups often rely on personal stories misinformation or studies that have been debunked or taken out of context  its important to look beyond rhetoric and evaluate the credibility and quality of the evidence supporting each side thats how we get closer to the truth and make informed decisions,skeptic,,yes,,
they dont have better arguments they just are more excited and show more energy,,,,,
 patoastral2118  of course they are probably because they have better arguments ,,,,,
people should not be taking health advice from me rfk,,,,,
typical from many commenters white dr being defended while very diverse group of people are called names,,,,,
i think all of this is a result of social media and things people read online everyone is an expert now   i try to keep this thought in mind from an article i read about flying an airplane when youre flying in the dark or in a low visibility situation the only thing you can trust is your instrument panel your mind may be telling you something different but you have to learn how to put aside these thoughts and trust your instruments  were all flying in the dark through life essentially our only guide is that instrument panel which is science,,,,,
wow this dude really got destroyed he had no words especially in the beginning questions this really highlighted the fact that vaccines arent without certain agendas attached and work differently for different people,pro-vaccine,,,,
im a vaxxer but that dude at the 30 min mark was cooking  my take away  its possible to have two truths,skeptic,,,,
tom by far is the safest people out of this group,,,,,
bro you cant sue a vaccine manufacturer they literally have protection from fault granted by the government,skeptic,,,,
rfk upheld the myth that black people dont feel pain like other people to that black brother please look at who youre defending,,,,,yes
vaccines prevent getting an illness uh im pretty sure its the exact opposite at least in regards to flu and cold type vaccines,pro-vaccine,,,,
the guest should be given time to articulate a comprehensive answer not cut them off due to the participant at the desk being voted out at least give 35 minutes please change the format otherwise brilliant program,,,yes,,
these folks are something like wow  also spontaneous abortion you mean miscarriage,,,,,
the brain was discovered in 1102  people before,,,,,
this format was crap its almost like the makers of this shitshow wanted to the appease the anthrax looks,,,yes,,
doctor mike vs 20 of the most anecdotal tin foil anti vaxxers xx  with that said im not also for all vaccines either lol i also like that dr mike admitted that the big pharma is corrupt financially,skeptic,neutral,,,
if every antivaxer checked their bias watched the first 5 minutes every single person who has any hope of correction would be corrected anyone who isnt convinced at that point is completely hopeless also yes if you deprive your children of the standard vaccines currently offered by the health care system you are a bad parent,skeptic,,yes,,
this dr is bought and paid for by face,,,,,
so the dr thinks rfk is a threat because he doesnt understand science  my question is then does the dr agree with rachel levine and view him as a threat as well,,,,,
im really shocked at how little people read and who think anecdotes are worthy reasons for life decisions,,,,,
2338 why was this dude so aggressive,,,,,
she reads and studies what,,,,,
debates dont work that way its a battle of facts and logic not who is the most energetic,,,yes,,
instead of suing manufacturers directly individuals who believe theyre been injured by a vaccine can file a claim through the national vaccine injury compensation program vice this program provides compensation for rare vaccinerelated injuries and is funded by a small tax on vaccines if a claim through the vice is denied or the individual is unsatisfied with the compensation they still have the option to pursue a lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer in civil court but only under very limited circumstances these cases are rare and typically require proving that the manufacturer was negligent or that the vaccine was defective in some way the system is designed to balance protecting vaccine manufacturers to encourage vaccine development while still offering a pathway for people to seek justice if they suffer harm however most vaccine injury claims are resolved through the vice which aims to provide faster and more accessible compensation than traditional lawsuits,skeptic,,yes,,
thats a question for a lawyer or pharmacists not a doctor,,,,,
since these two arent supposed to be deadly is more beneficial to experience it than avoid it,,,,,
how so  he didnt address the big concerns people have  why no placebo controlled safety studies  why vaccine manufacturers have legal immunity,pro-vaccine,,,yes,
people who still take those arguments seriously are beyond help,,,,,
how so,,,,,
i understand why people might be suspicious of doctors and public health officials especially with so much misinformation out there however accusing someone of being bought and paid for without any evidence doesnt help the conversation  doctors like dr mike base their information on decades of scientific research and clinical experience not on personal agendas public health recommendations come from large bodies of independent scientists around the world not just one individual  its important to focus on the facts and evidence rather than unfounded accusations thats how we can have productive discussions about health and safety,,neutral,yes,,
its important to separate personal opinions from evidencebased science when a doctor says someone doesnt understand science theyre usually referring to how that person interprets or presents scientific data not about their personal identity or beliefs  dr makes critiques of rfk jr focus on misinformation related to vaccines and public health based on scientific consensus comparing that to someone like rachel levine who is a public health official with medical and scientific credentials isnt really the same thing  the focus should be on the accuracy of information and how it aligns with scientific evidence rather than personal attacks or unrelated comparisons,skeptic,,yes,,
so you believe that peppers cause aids this question seems to imply that since he doesnt prove of this figure being where it is then he proves of this other figure with is hilarious to think as a serious argument,,,,,
if it wasnt for vaccines and modern medicine all these people would be considered middle aged or eol,skeptic,,,,
fact checkout exactly impartial,,,,,
the first woman was rude,,,,,
imagine being a doctor and dealing with these people on a daily basis,,,,,
nothing screams vaccines work like mine only works when you take yours,pro-vaccine,,,,
damn doctor mike gained some weight,,neutral,,,
love you dr mike but i think a more efficient way to debate in this scenario would have been listening but not for too long you didnt get to make any points because you were voted out as soon as you started talking because the other person sampled on for 34 minutes,,neutral,yes,,

its so sad these people have been so mislead this conversation hurts me so bad,,,,,yes
small pox doesnt live long outside of the body btw so the whole indigenous blanket arguement means nothing,,,,,
think of vaccines like putting up a fence around your house to keep burglary out if only a few houses in the neighborhood have fences burglary can easily move from one unprotected house to another but if most houses have fences it becomes much harder for burglary to get in anywhere protecting the whole neighborhood  similarly when most people get fascinated it creates a kind of community shield that makes it harder for the virus to spread protecting everyoneeven those who cant put up their own fence,skeptic,,,,

1128 dude said he agreed about preventing instead of curing but doesnt support vaccines  these people cannot be real ,pro-vaccine,,,,
mra is not a vaccine,skeptic,,,,
ive been watching dr makes channel for years and hes changed his mind a lot about medicines infallibility,,,,,
one important aspect to mention about going back to nature we cant its impossible we have fundamentally changed the earth in a point of which is irreversible and created new variables not of nature which nature can not defend our new world requires more than just what the planet provided before and its our fault and we cant do anything about it the pollution we have caused will stay in this planet for millions of not billions years not just pollution but how we have also caused the rapid evolution and extinction of species creating super viruses and destroying ecosystems which will never go away,,,yes,,
this is a shift representation on both sides,,,,,
they could have had atleast 1 scientist,,,,,
im 23mins in and this is difficult to watch so far the doctor is barely getting an opportunity to speak i hope going forward there is more debating with back and forth discourse between both speakers with the floor,,,,,
vaccines work however they treat people like stats even if the number of people who died from the vaccine is low playing russian roulette with your kids lives with a forced vaccination is not worth it you could be that stat but hey millions are fine,pro-vaccine,,,,
these debates have a critical failure  they let the person fish gallon through a italy of claims that the dr never gets a chance to address  thats crap  participants should be instructed and held to a single most importantsupported claim they wish to make then their mic silenced then the dr gets to address it  otherwise much of this is just a waste of time,,,yes,,
the guy referring to guns as accidents is so strange,,,,,
kudos to doctor mike for keeping a straight face,,neutral,,,

"i would rather have autism over smallpox any day of the week i would rather have autism than suffer the guilt of potentially being patient zero for an epidemic i would rather have autism than survive yet spread potentially incapable terrible diseases to my loved ones",,,,yes,
the whole autism thing is so ridiculous to be completely honest im autistic and i dont have any vaccines thats not how autism works,pro-vaccine,,,yes,
dope its doctor mike,,neutral,,,
actually mra vaccines are vaccines they work by teaching your cells how to make a harmless piece of the virus spike protein which then triggers your immune system to recognize and fight the real virus if youre exposed  this is just a new type of vaccine technology different from traditional ones that use weakened or inactivated viruses but the goal is the same to train your immune system to protect you from disease  so mra vaccines fit the definition of vaccinesthey help your body prepare to defend itself without causing illness,pro-vaccine,,yes,,
10 times larger  and i dont drink soda  generalizations are insulting,,,,,
 nadogrl what size burger you eat ,,,,,

people have used the word brave to describe people in these scenarios the word id use for dr mike is noble as much as id love for those people to have better lives and not be misinformed i dont have the patience to talk to these people  when he asked the repaired lady is there anything i can say that can change your mind actually this should be a prerequisite for everyone sitting there falsifiability is such an important tenet of science i dont think you should be allowed to debate unless you understand that and can come up with evidence that would change your mind,,neutral,yes,,
so i had never heard of doctor mike before this video but i think hes probably my favorite surrounded subject he feels less like a debate and more like a compassionate doctor who wants to help these people help themselves,,neutral,yes,,yes
4209 this woman is insufferable,,,,,
i feel kind of badger doctor mike most of these people are drilling fools i do feel bad for some of them that actually fell victim to the misinformation but the others that arent open to talking about it are idiots,,positive,yes,,yes

its funny how they keep voting themselves out overtime the one on the chair comes to his senses and starts agreeing with the doc,,,,,
lol at the fact checks coming up  these people are insane,,,,,yes
uncontrolled pathogenic spike protein production is also a massive issue,,,,,
the massive problem was they mandated a first generation biotechnology in the face of natural immunity,,,,,
i dont know what to think of dr mike after he said there is no such thing as absolute truth then said facts change based on when observed if he doesnt understand there is such a thing as absolute truth and facts never change otherwise it wouldnt be a fact see the earth was and is always round regardless if people think it is flat the problem is with science and medicine in most instances we dont have facts but rather beliefs based on what we can observe at the time to treat these beliefs as fact as dr mike seems to misunderstand basic principles of logic i dont see how he can be taken as an authority on issues when he is so confused,,negative,,,
wow this isnt fair play at all   ive watched the first 20 minutes and this is the pattern an antivaxxer comes along and speaks for straight 23 minutes or more putting across their views regardless of what the topic of contention is simultaneously the red flags begin to pop but interesting at a speed that allows this speaker to complete their full thought  then as soon as the doctor begins to respond the red flags cross the 50 threshold and the antivaxxer is asked to go this means the antivaxxer has put across their points completely for the online viewers to consume but the doctor hasn   my suggestion to the channel dont register any new red flags when the person doctor in this case at the center speaks,skeptic,,yes,,
religious notions are the worst,,,,,
this is infuriating too many people conflated the racist history colonialism and medical experimentation with the proven track record of vaccines people need to visit 18th and 19th century cemeteries and see all the small headstone for babies  doctor mike was far too respectful and he never cut off his debates next time have an ultraaggressive new york doctor take the chair,skeptic,positive,yes,,
lady we have been oppressed by the government does she know rfk jr is part of this govt,,,,,
poor guy,,,,,
46 minutes in and i cant stand the lack of education  major credit to the health professional for being patient especially with the latina woman,,,,,
lets stop getting vaccines confused with the experimental drug that was issued in 20212,skeptic,,,,
i really hated how the christian girl got voted out i really wanted to hear more about it because im a christian and i wanted to see a religious view on this debate,,,yes,,
gooooooaattttt,,,,,
this feels like 20 mental health patients vs a psychiatrist,,,,,yes
nobody regrets not taking vaccines,skeptic,,,,
i think this is one of the worst videos ive seen from this series never before in any of the episodes have i seen people stray so far from the claims of the person they are meant to be debating i mean seriously what was the point in dr mike even stating the claim when nearly every single vaccine skeptic openly ignored it and immediately started discussing something else jubilee is fortunate that mike held him self so well throughout this because the subversion of the claims he presented would drive other debates up the wall,skeptic,neutral,yes,,
poor dude well groomed,,,,,
havent met a religious person who isnt a nutjob at least at some level,,,,,
 brian40  touché ,,,,,

it is interesting to look at the guests that jubilee picked for this one all the other episodes usually have guests with degrees or are extremely well read about the topic they seem to have only picked emotional people who use anecdotes,,,,,
5 minutes in do any antivaxxers have anything to say thats not some dubious anecdotal story about a member of their family,skeptic,,,,
i am not antivaccinei am anti mra science applied to vaccine creations   there is a difference,skeptic,,,,
no one is talking about how respectful dr mike is he actually listened and stayed cool calm and collected and didnt raise his voice,,positive,,,

oh so me getting fascinated is what caused my autismadhd to get worse not the sexual base making it worse and adding pts huh sure makes sense totally not the trauma response huh ,,,,yes,
the saying a little knowledge is a dangerous thing means that a shallow understanding of a topic can lead to overconfidence and potentially harmful decisions someone with limited knowledge might mistakenly believe they have more expertise than they actually do leading to mistakes or bad advice,,,,,
many of those people when they were not in front of mike didnt even let a minimum conversation unfold before anxious raising their hand to put forward their believes showing how they weren putting a minimum amount of effort to do the basic to listen,,negative,,,
a plural of anecdotes is not data  all here are anecdotal stories in place of evidence,,,,,
yes,,,,,
idiocracy is here my friend the locos are leading the asylum,,,,,yes
you dont trust yourself people that lack any trust in any government are people that deep down know they themselves have the bad that they see in the government,,,,,

one pharma employee 20 skeptics rightly questioning corporate products from cartels fined billions for fraud  corruption,,,,,
mistergadomsky4577and yet you are in a pc which sells corporate products to you    vaccines were being researched across the world simultaneously by actual research labs and universities the best came to work on these to try to eradicate disease  this is not the same as olympic thats being touted as a messiah when it clearly has to be used your whole life rather than a combined approach with far cell removals post weight loss  furthermore if you hate cartels so much lay off that beer and drugs because majority of you are drinks,pro-vaccine,,,,

as someone that has anecdotal experience  a lot of parents that have autistic kids that i know were having way too much partying fun in high school and university but do you think they disclosed this to their doctor   hey i took xyz elicit drugs they then out of not wanting to accept guilt or in some cases sheer luck if they had a healthy life want to claim everything else causes autism because we humans fear being responsible whether through genetics or our own behavior for autism which to these parents is seen as a defect a tara as we like to call it   some say its mercury others peanut in vaccines they keep inventing lol,anti-vaccine,,,yes,
remember as shift as american thinks how bad their healthcare are its still miles better than what people has in 3rd world countries  its like comparing a lamborghini with a beat down car,,,,,

as soon as you bring up joe organ and facebook as your information about healthcare youre automatically discredited in my perspective maybe you should read some books by renowned scientists,,,yes,,
this is find sad how did we get here,,,,,yes
i love how dr mike is able to stay calm and give his educated response in a respectful way and acknowledge their frustrations but he ha shares his experience and education in a way that is clear and concise  even if they still dont agree with him in regards to how they feel about things,,positive,,,yes

i take issue with many of these perspectives if a government or group truly intended to reduce the population there are far more effective and discreet methods than mass highly visible vaccination campaigns using vaccines as a depopulation tool would be one of the least efficient and most easily scrutinized approaches imaginable,skeptic,,,,

12223 the red hair lady is in delusion at this point because she is not ready to accept anything even if it is a fact,,,,,
me being a medical student myself  was so shocked to see how much misinformation many people have and then telling dr mike how they have read this and that and in reality it was all they would have heard somewhere and  never bothered to fact check it or even know how a disease spreads and they come here and try to question him who had undergone so many years of med school and residency and knows the disease inside out is just appalling because throughout watching the video my expressions were just of shock ,,neutral,yes,,
not impressed with rfk ,,,,,
i think some of these things are valid but that one girl whos a conspiracy theorist made my eyes roll,,,,yes,
so far everyone in this video just got up and proved his point with their arguments  ,,,,,
1347 so far no one has given dr mike chance to even talk nor have any of them even tried to prove against his claim they havent asked what lies dr mike is referring to 2048 a lot of did you know a lot of people that didnt learn things when they were younger all the sudden wanting to learn stuff and think they are in some kind of special in the know underground people 2340 again they switch once dr mike starts talking,,positive,,,
it seems like they all start to vote for a new speaker as soon as hes given a chance to respond,,,yes,,
an hour in and so far it seems like its more 6 out of 20 available antivaxxers against one doctor lol,skeptic,,,,

that woman said what do they need protection against in the first couple hours of life like are you aware of what happens in a hospital,,,,,
was she forced or not cause dr mike asked if she was forced and she said no about a minute later she said she was forced to get the vaccine,skeptic,neutral,,,
this guy is should have been the one in facts position not face,,,,,
that lady with the rhead was the most unsigned of the group like wtf was the point of her being there when she fully admitted that what ever drive said wouldnt really change her mind,,,,,
wow its a choice get the vaccine or lose your job mention everything yeah sounds like a choice ,skeptic,,,,

yeah they really should pause the conversation and fact check verbally,,,,,
we should have the choice period,,,,,
i love how the guy with the funny jacket got hockey mocked in the closing remarks lol,,,,,
i encourage these people to move to places in the world that weren as fortunate as them to even be able to get fascinated regardless of whether they believed they were effective or not  maybe they should trade places with people who want to live a better and healthier life but are unable to solely because of the place they were born,,,,,

these debuts dont understand the difference between asking a question and making an impassioned uninformed speech,,,,,
he is basically teaching basic science to these people lol,,,,,
the reason why those people are so off is cause they havent learn to be open to ideas so now when one of them tries to speak the others dont even give them a chance  basically they are getting a taste of their own medicine problem is i still dont think they ll even realize any of this,,,,,
there are medical doctors out there who became antivaxxers discussions between them and doc mike would be interesting and we could truly learn something why not be fair,skeptic,neutral,,,

omg the third guy was soooooo fringe he was all over the place trying to quickly get in so many different points when in all reality he just wanted to start a racecolonialism debate treating each other better having clean food having media that doesnt lie we all want that for ourselves and our kids but that has nothing to do with the debate at hand which is should we be giving people vaccines or not how hard is it for some of these people to just think rationally and leave their emotions out of it and stay on topic,skeptic,,yes,,
the first lady sounds like she made up all the i have a friend i have another friend stories she might have been telling the truth but the tone and the way she speaks makes her sound like those kids in school that used to make up stories on the spot,,,,,

how can dr mike with a straight face say that unvaccinated kids would put fascinated kids are risk that statement is so illogical surely it is the unvaccinated kid that is at risk not the kids who have had the vaccine otherwise it kind of just goes against his entire argument that vaccines prevent disease either vaccines work by protecting the fascinated and it then follows that they are at lower risk than unvaccinated kids or the fascinated kids are at more of a risk than the unvaccinated which is it,pro-vaccine,positive,,,
i dont know how dr mike can call the cdc independent review bodies when he probably knows there is a revolving door between the pharma companies and the cdc and when it is the pharma companies that pay the cdc for their independent reviews as well as lobbying government for fewer regulations in essence the pharma companies regulate themselves and review their own drugs to market this is exactly how they have been able to lack transparency and hide data that shows their drugs to be far more harmful than is ever let on just look at how the tackle family were able to manipulate the cdc to label oxycontin as less addictive than other opioids even when they were more than 4 times more addictive this is precisely because of the revolving door between the cdc and big pharma this is exactly what rfk jnr is bringing to an end and it is not before time,,neutral,,,
the entirety of this room is just an echo chamber passive aggressive and just nods to everything being said only one or two of them actually had a meaningful argument and were well spoken its so difficult to have a discourse with people like them and i feel bad for dr mike for sitting there with them trying to provide his professional perspective yet the people are just listening to what they want to hear,,neutral,,,yes
classic survivorship bias if it didnt happen to me then it cant happen classic logical fallacy,,,,,
most of them didnt even debate against dr makes quotes they just started ranting about their own experiences with vaccines if my teacher said anti vaccine lies cost lives they would expect me to argument why they arent lies and why it doesnt cost lives not say well my friend had a stroke after taking a vaccine so i feel threatened of course they have valid reasons to distrust vaccines but they need to keep the topic consistent,skeptic,,yes,,yes

brush even when it comes to young males the affected demographic were talking about 25 cases at most per million doses and the symptoms are generally mild in comparison the risk of developing myocarditis from the sickness itself would be 26 times higher without the vaccine so even when we highlight this particular effect its a weak argument,skeptic,,,,

i think when the speakers are voted out and 9 flags are raised instead of instantly stopping them from talking they should be given 1 more minute to speak so that any remaining points can be properly touched on and not interrupted a time limit will give the voters what they want while also giving the speakers a final chance to combat with their argument,,,yes,,
let the doctor speak this is so frustrating to watch fr,,,,,

i hope the red haired woman children can escape their mothers thought patterns,,,,,
never once before in history has vaccine immunity been considered better than naturallyinduced immunity from catching an actual disease and pharma actually sponsors and funds medical school as well as medical textbook publication so all the information doctors learn is from pharma pharma knows that they can give vaccines to everybody because they have been made immune from any liability this also means they have absolutely 0 incentive to actually do the proper research they need to do to make vaccination safe,pro-vaccine,,yes,,
sorry dr mike but in this case you are a moon who has not done their actual research none of these vaccines have been properly tested as any other drug or pharmaceutical product not once let alone in the massive combinations they are given in there is so many reasons he is wrong and he obviously has never had a mother who has said something about their child having a major vaccine reaction he has probably said that it is a coincidence these mothers and others here that are vaccinehesitant or anthrax they know what theyre talking about they know the history they know their children and they know what theyre seen,skeptic,neutral,,,yes
